# ForbCheck (forb)

**ForbCheck** is a Bash CLI tool designed to analyze a compiled C executable or library and detect the usage of **forbidden functions**, closely matching how projects are evaluated at 42.

It relies on `nm` to inspect unresolved symbols and reports **exact source locations** where forbidden functions are used.

---

## Key Features

* **Deep Analysis:** Uses `nm` and object file scanning (`.o`) to distinguish between undefined symbols and your own internal functions. No more false positives from your own utils.
* **Smart Context Awareness:** Automatically detects external libraries like **MiniLibX** (`-mlx`) or **Math** (`-lm`) to avoid flagging allowed external calls.
* **Blazing Fast:** Optimized parallel scanning (`xargs -P4`). Runs in under **0.2s** on most projects.
* **Stale Binary Detection:** Smartly compares source code timestamps with your binary. If you forgot to `make re`, ForbCheck warns you that results might be outdated.
* **Precision Locator:** Pinpoints exactly where the forbidden function is called (file and line number).

## 🆕 What's New in v1.6.1

### Smarter False-Positive Filtering
* **Comment Ignoring:** ForbCheck is now smart enough to ignore forbidden keywords found in comments (e.g., `// TODO: remove printf`). It only flags code that actually compiles!

### Smart Sync & Cache
* **Desync Warning:** Modified your `.c` files but forgot to recompile? The tool now alerts you immediately to prevent testing against an old binary.
* **Undo-Friendly:** The intelligent cache tracks line counts and file sizes. If you undo changes (Ctrl+Z), the warning resolves itself automatically.

### Enhanced CLI Experience
* **Hybrid List Command:** Use `-l` to view all authorized functions, or `forb -l <func>` to quickly check the status of a specific one.
* **Global Awareness:** Seamlessly switch between projects (e.g., `minishell` -> `cub3d`). The tool updates its internal reference context instantly.
* **Cleaner Help:** A reorganized `--help` menu for better readability during those late-night coding sessions.

- Optimized: Even on standard school lab machines, the overhead remains negligible, ensuring your workflow is never interrupted.

### Show execution time:

```bash
forb -t minishell (with forbidden fonctions)
```

<img width="532" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/383a258a-ce57-4c07-98f8-2e5d0cc2eac3" />


### Limit analysis to specific files:

```bash
forb minishell -f heredoc_utils.c
```

<img width="538" height="202" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ae6c24a-7452-45ee-aaaf-00f5ffdfcda4" />


### Verbose mode:

```bash
forb -v minishell
```
<img width="545" height="196" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81af8b99-552e-47d7-92e0-83916e4a9bec" />

## Authorized Functions

Authorized functions are defined in:

```text
$HOME/.forb/authorize.txt
```

Functions may be separated by new lines, spaces, or commas.

Quick edit:

```bash
forb -e
```

Example:

```text
read
write
malloc
free
```

or

```text
read, write, malloc, free
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|----|---------|
| `0` | No forbidden functions detected |
| `1` | Forbidden functions detected or error occurred |

---

## Design Philosophy

ForbCheck is designed to be:

- Simple
- Readable
- Useful before project evaluations
- Explicit rather than permissive

It is an assistance tool, not a substitute for understanding project requirements.
